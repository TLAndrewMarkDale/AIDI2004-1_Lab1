This simple program allows you to enter numbers and it will print the sorted list.

To run this program, simply use the following command:
> python simple_program_lab1.py

This will prompt you to enter a random assortment of numbers. Once finished, simply type the command 'done' and you will be presented with the sorted list.
The list is sorted using bubble sort.
For example, if you enter 1, 2, 98, 23, 13, 0, 98, 88, 73
The program will then return, "Sorted list: [0, 1, 2, 13, 23, 73, 88, 98, 98].
